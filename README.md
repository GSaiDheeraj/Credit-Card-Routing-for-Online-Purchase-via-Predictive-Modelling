### Methodology: CRISP-DM  (Cross Industry Standard process for Data Mining)
  1) <b>Problem</b> : Help the business to automate the credit card routing via a predictive model. Such a model should increase the 
payment success rate by finding the best possible PSP for each transaction and at the same time keep the 
transaction fees low.
Data Set:
The data set and all relevant information from the business side (name of PSPs, transaction fees) are given in a 
separate *.zip folder, which is available in myCampus, under the section Case Study.
  2) Data Gathering :  
  3) Data Cleaning : Removed the Duplicates in the data and handled null values in the data.
  4) Data Preparation : Created new business faturesd based on the data analysis and the features.
  5) Modelling : Used Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost models                                                                                                                                                                                        


     -Why These multiple models?                                                                                                                                                                                         
     Answer) Usually, we try simple model to complex model and look the metrics for understanding right model.
  6) Deployment
  7) maintainence.
